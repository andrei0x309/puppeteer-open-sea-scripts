## Pupetter scrips for OpenSea

Some scripts I used on OpenSea, not garuanteed to work since pupetter scripts are known to break easily when webistes change.

* createAssets.js - Used for creating assets speed rate is 100 / 4-6 min. 
* getCollIds.js - Used to get token ids from a collection with unsupported ERC1155 not optimized script since I found that opensea skips assets in the list if the collections is accesed normally it needs to be accesed by search in order to return all assets. So it's based on chrome zoom it might not be useful for a collection greater then 100 items. 
* sellAsset.js - Used to list an asset for selling is pretty fast.
